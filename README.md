# streamr-specs

This repository contains different technical specifications for the Streamr API and protocol. 

The audience for these materials is mainly developers of Streamr, its SDKs etc., and they can be highly technical. Documentation aimed for Streamr *users* would be better placed in the [user docs](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-platform/tree/development/app/src/docs).
